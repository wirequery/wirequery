# Getting Started

## Setting up the SDK

Once WireQuery is installed, it is time to set up an SDK for your applications. The SDKs allow your applications to send
and receive the required data from and to WireQuery, so you can query them. You can find the SDKs in the main README.

In order to be able to provide an API key, you need to create an application in WireQuery. Go to 'Applications', click '
New', choose a 'Name' and a 'Description' and click 'Save'.
